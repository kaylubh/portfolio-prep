## professional pitch notes

Current version:

Hi, I’m Caleb Hemphill. I’m a developer who enjoys using the flexibility of programming to overcome challenges and create better experiences. I’ve always held a strong interest in technology which I have previously neglected but refocused on in order to pursue a life and career I can be passionate about every day. I most recently worked in customer service focused roles in retail and restaurant environments, these roles taught me the importance of adapting to rapidly changing situations and working collaboratively with a team. Before that, I served nine years in the Army as an intelligence analyst where I had the opportunity to be a part of and support impactful missions in a wide variety of roles. Going forward, I hope to use my diverse background and experiences along with my reignited passion for technology to find new opportunities to use the infinite potential of computing to leave a positive impact on humanity.

Notes:

I’m currently studying software and web development through an intensive program at Code Fellows and expect to graduate in March 2024. I recently decided to make a career pivot because I realized I wanted to be passionate about the work I do every day. I have a diverse background, having served 9 years in the Army as an Intelligence Analyst and spending some time in customer service focused roles afterwards. These experiences have taught me how to adapt to any situation and the importance of effective teamwork. Software development has always fascinated me and I hope to use this new skill set in a position that focuses on using technology to simplify and solve challenging problems.

These experiences helped me develop a broader understanding of the human experience which would have likely taken me many more years to learn had I not joined the Army.

## tech passion notes

I love using technology to make life easier and more enjoyable. The awesome potential of computing to do everything from solve problems to provide entertainment never ceases to amaze me. I hope to find ways I can contribute to the ever evolving world of technology.
